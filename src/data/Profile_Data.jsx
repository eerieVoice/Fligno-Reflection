      "I'm Jemuel M. Maglupay, but my family and younger relatives sometimes call me Jem or manong. This coming December 2023, I will be 23 years old. My date of birth is December 22, 2000. At present, I'm residing in Sto. Niño, Lapasan, Cagayan de Oro due to my academic pursuits, although my permanent address is in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. My fascination with computers began during my childhood when my cousin allowed us to play games and explore the internet on the computer. During my secondary education, I grew even more passionate about computers, which led me to pursue a career in the IT field. In my tertiary education, I chose to study computer engineering because I couldn't decide whether to focus on hardware or software.",
