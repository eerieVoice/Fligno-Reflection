          The department in Algorand blockchain development involves designing
          and developing dApps that run on the Algorand blockchain. As an
          intern, the department benefited from my fresh perspective, and
          willingness to learn. I spent my hours during the practicum by always
          going back to the basics to better understand the program and allowing
          what I learned to good practice. From my experience in the company, I
          have learned the importance individuality, teamwork and the value of
          continuously learning new skills and technologies. I enjoyed my
          experience with the people in the company they are very positive and
          accomodating. The most memorable event during my practicum was
          successfully deploying my dApp on Algorand's blockchain and seeing it
          work as intended. My advice to those who will take their practicum in
          the near future is to be open-minded, willing to learn, and proactive
          in seeking out opportunities to contribute to the department.
